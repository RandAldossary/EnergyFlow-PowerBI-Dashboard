## Problem Statement

This Power BI dashboard is designed to help organizations gain deeper insights into their energy consumption patterns, both renewable and non-renewable. By visualizing key metrics such as usage trends, cost distribution, and energy sources, it enables stakeholders to identify areas of inefficiency and take informed steps toward optimizing energy usage.

With clear data on consumption spikes, cost drivers, and reliance on non-renewable resources, this dashboard helps decision makers set actionable goals for cost savings and sustainability. If the data reveals a heavy dependency on non-renewables or rising energy costs, targeted strategies can be implemented to shift towards greener, more efficient solutions.
